# Vendor_Split
This project uses Appscipt to sort vendors based on the product prices they offer. This program's primary purpose is to reduce purchasing costs, it uses map(fucntion(row)) to change 2D arrays to 1D, and loops through each vendors listed price and finds the minimum then it assigns the respective product to the respective vendor sheet to be sent out to the respective vendors
